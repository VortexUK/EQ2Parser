# EQ2Parser — Engine Behaviour Reference

The authoritative description of how the Core engine behaves — algorithms,
thresholds, formulas, field names — in one place. Source comments across
`EQ2Parser.Core` cite this document by section (e.g. "§3") for the exact
counting rules, so the section numbering below is stable.

**Stat definitions are a contract.** The formulas in §3 (EncDPS, durations,
ally resolution, success level, the idle rule) feed the numbers shown in the
app and uploaded to EQ2Lexicon. They are kept **stable and consistent** on
purpose: changing a definition would fork the site's rankings into
incomparable eras, so improvements go into architecture, robustness,
performance and UX — never into a formula that moves a published number.
Correctness is validated by replaying real logs and checking the resulting
numbers against the community-standard values raiders expect.

**Design choices worth stating up front:**

- A shrunk/truncated log file is detected and the reader restarts from 0
  rather than stalling.
- Timing comes from the line's unix epoch prefix, not the bracketed
  local-time string — the epoch is unambiguous across locale/DST.
- Encounter identity is never index-based (no fragile "position in a list"
  handle that a mid-list insert can invalidate).
- One log source is parsed single-threaded (channel-fed), so consumers need
  no lock discipline.
- 1-second log granularity is disambiguated by a per-line monotonic
  `TimeSorter` — load-bearing for ordering and duplicate detection.

## Key capabilities (decided 2026-07-29)

1. **Multi-log parsing with encounter correlation** — the headline feature.
   One parse pipeline per log source: own tail reader, own grammar instance,
   own perspective state (owner name, "YOUR" resolution, zone, in-combat).
   An **encounter correlator** groups concurrent encounters across sources
   into one canonical encounter by zone identity + time overlap + shared
   enemy set, and keeps them separate when zones differ. Per-combatant
   authority within a merged encounter: a character's own log is
   authoritative for that character (an EQ2 log only fully records its
   owner); combatants no source owns go to the source that recorded them
   most completely. A configurable **primary character** scopes trigger
   audio/TTS/timers so multiple sources don't double-fire alerts.
2. **Catch-up on attach** — starting mid-raid rewinds a configurable window
   (or to the last zone change) and replays, instead of seeking to
   end-of-file and losing the current fight.
3. **Grammar as data** — the line grammar is pattern data per language
   (EN first, RU next), one engine for all languages.
4. **Trigger matching that scales** — source-generated regexes + a literal
   prefilter, not an every-trigger×every-line scan.
5. **Configurable magic numbers** — idle timeout (6 s), trigger audio
   rate-limit (1 s), spell-timer dedupe (2 s), sub-timer window (12 s) are
   all settings with sensible defaults.
6. **SQLite history from day one** — every swing queryable across sessions;
   encounter replay; survives crashes.
7. **Diagnostics as a feature** — structured event log, upload arrival
   verification, payload-size visibility.
8. **Live trigger reload + site trigger-pack subscription** — active
   triggers re-evaluate on edit (not only on zone change); trigger and
   spell-timer packs subscribe per-encounter from EQ2Lexicon.
9. **True owner death counts** (2026-08-04 — a deliberate, user-approved
   accuracy decision). In the owner's own log a real self-death is always
   second person ("has killed you."); a third-person death naming the owner
   can only be a temp pet dying under their name (e.g. the Templar hammer —
   verified: 82 own-name deaths were all hammer expiries vs 16 real
   "killed you" deaths, zero shape overlap). Own-name third-person kills are
   marked as pet deaths: excluded from Deaths / kill credit / success, shown
   separately in the death report. Third parties' deaths are left as-is —
   their shapes are genuinely indistinguishable from a single log
   (buff-fade correlation was tested and rejected: 44% coincidence vs 49%
   signal); per-combatant authority lets each character's own log correct
   their own count.

## 1. Log reading

- **Polling, not watchers** — no FileSystemWatcher. The reader thread checks
  `Length > Position` every 10 ms; a 1 s timer forces a read attempt
  regardless; a folder scan for a newer `eq2log*.txt` every 10 s handles
  rollover.
- Opens with `FileShare.ReadWrite`, seeks to end — history is never replayed
  on a live tail.
- Reads the whole pending tail, splits on CR/LF (empties removed), and holds
  back the final fragment unless the block ended with a terminator: **a line
  is never dispatched until its terminator is seen**.
- Default encoding UTF-8 (BOM detection can override). The timestamp prefix
  is stripped before trigger matching.
- Timestamp parse: the unix `(epoch)` prefix is authoritative; the bracketed
  `[Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy]` local-time string is skipped (locale/DST
  ambiguous). `LastKnownTime` + a stopwatch give `LastEstimatedTime`
  (interpolated log time) — spell timers tick on THIS, not wall time.
- A file that has grown past its configured split size is treated as a fresh
  log (rollover).
- On attach mid-file, a zone look-behind scans a bounded window behind the
  start offset for the most recent "You have entered …" line (and its
  instance lockout), so zone-scoped timers and instance identity are known
  before the next zoning.

### Line pipeline (exact order, serialized under one lock)

1. Parse time; increment global `TimeSorter`.
2. **Idle-timeout check** (may end the current encounter — before anything
   sees the line).
3. Record the line into the active encounter's log (if in combat).
4. Evaluate **custom triggers** (timestamp-stripped text) — live lines only.
5. Chat trigger-share sniff (lines carrying `<Trigger …/>` / `<Spell …/>`).
6. Scripted-win say-line check (bosses that end by script, not death).
7. The grammar runs, turning the line into engine calls (`SetEncounter` +
   `AddSwing` per action) synchronously on the reader thread.

## 2. Encounter lifecycle

- **Explicit start contract**: `SetEncounter(time, attacker, victim)` is
  called before every action; `AddSwing` throws if not in combat.
  `SetEncounter` creates the encounter (and its `ZoneData`), fires
  combat-start, stamps `LastHostileTime`, sets `InCombat`.
- An encounter's official start time is set when its FIRST action arrives
  (not at `SetEncounter`).
- **Idle end rule**: in combat AND `now − LastHostileTime > idle limit` →
  end combat. Default **6 seconds**, on by default, checked on every new log
  line (log-time driven) with a wall-clock backstop at limit+2 s.
- **Silence cutting** (off unless configured): a gap larger than the limit
  closes the current time segment and opens a new one — the encounter gets
  multiple Start/End segments and dead air is excluded from Duration.
- `EndCombat`: drain pending actions → mark inactive → finalize (trim +
  title) → fire combat-end → history record → prune → exports.
- **Title** = "strongest enemy": among non-ally combatants, score
  `DamageTaken / max(Deaths, 1)` (integer division), take the highest. Until
  finalize the title is the placeholder "Encounter".
- **Success level**: 0 = indeterminate (no allies / no resolvable enemy);
  else `enemyDied` = strongest enemy has Deaths > 0, `allySurvived` = some
  ally with 0 deaths whose name has no space (the "is a player" heuristic
  used throughout). Both → **1** (win); one → **2** (partial); neither →
  **3** (loss). A curated scripted-win say line forces **1** for bosses that
  never die in the traditional sense.
- Zone changes do NOT end combat by themselves. A zone re-entered as a fresh
  instance (new lockout) is treated as a distinct zone run.

## 3. Stat definitions (the stable contract)

Object graph: Zone → Encounter → Combatant (keyed UPPERCASE name) →
damage-type buckets → AttackType (per ability + synthetic "All") → swings.

**Buckets** with ally-polarity values: outgoing — Auto-Attack(−1),
Skill/Ability(−1), Outgoing Damage(0), Healed(+1), Power Drain(−1),
Power Replenish(+1), Cure/Dispel(0), Threat(−1), All Outgoing (Ref)(0);
mirrored incoming set. Swing types: 1 melee, 2 non-melee, 3 healing, 10
power drain, 13 power replenish, 16 threat, 20 cure/dispel. **Outgoing
damage lands in TWO buckets** (its split bucket + aggregate "Outgoing
Damage"); incoming lands in one. Unknown swing types are silently ignored
except for the Ref buckets.

**Dnum** (damage value type): >0 real, 0 no-damage, −1 miss, −2 resist,
−3 parry, −4 riposte, −5 block, −6…−9 custom/unknown, −10 death. Traps:
long→Dnum conversion clamps <−10 to −9; equality compares the custom STRING
too (a `-1 "Dodge"` is NOT equal to Miss); sums ignore negative operands.

**Key stats** (per AttackType, cached incrementally):

- Damage = Σ swings > 0. Hits = count ≥ 0 (block-is-hit default) — a
  0-damage swing IS a hit. Crits require the hit threshold. Misses = count
  == Miss. "Blocked"/avoids = count in −2…−9 excluding death.
- Median = upper median of non-negative damages. MinHit uses the hit
  threshold; MaxHit strictly > 0.
- AverageDelay (default mode) = duration / (distinct timestamps − 1).

**Duration — the load-bearing definition**:

- Encounter StartTime = earliest outgoing action by ANYONE (any type — the
  Ref bucket).
- Encounter EndTime (default) = **the last DAMAGING swing by an ALLY**
  ("ShortEndTime": max over allies of their Outgoing Damage bucket end).
  Trailing heals/threat/enemy actions do NOT extend an encounter.
- Multi-segment (silence-cut) encounters sum segment durations; combatant/
  ability durations clip their own swing windows to the encounter segments.
- Combatant personal window = their own first→last outgoing action (Ref
  bucket); a combatant with only incoming actions has Duration 0.

**DPS family**: `EncDPS = Damage / encounter Duration` (this is what the
encounter tables and uploads show); `DPS = Damage / personal Duration`.
Healing mirrors as EncHPS. Encounter-level Damage/Healed sum over ALLIES
only. Allied deaths exclude space-containing names (pets/NPCs).

**Kills/Deaths**: from the "Killing" attack type (or death-coded swings).
Allies get kill credit for anything; non-allies only for space-free victim
names.

**Ally detection**: an incremental interaction graph — every action adds
the bucket's polarity (±1) between the two parties. Resolution seeds from
the player and sign-propagates until stable; allies = everyone whose final
sign matches the player's. **If the player isn't in the encounter, the ally
set is empty** → Damage 0, title "Encounter", success 0. (This is why an
observer-only log parses "empty".)

## 4. Triggers + timers

**CustomTrigger fields**: regex (compiled once at construction), category
(default "General"), restrict-to-category/zone flag, active, timer flag +
timer name, sound type (0 none / 1 beep / 2 wav / 3 TTS) + sound data,
tabbed + tab age. Key = `category|regex`.

**Trigger share XML** — the format raiders paste into chat to hand triggers
around. This is the one place interop with ACT matters: the `<Trigger …/>`
/ `<Spell …/>` shape is ACT's, so a snippet copied from either tool imports
into the other. Trigger attributes, in order: `R` regex (escaped; `#`→
`&#35;`, `\\`→`&#92;&#92;`, `\s`→`&#92;s`), `SD` sound data, `ST` sound type
int, `CR` restrict T/F, `C` category, `T` timer T/F, `TN` timer name,
`Ta` tabbed T/F. On import `R` + `C` are required (they form the identity
key; existing triggers update in place); other attributes are individually
optional. Booleans are exactly "T".

**Evaluation**: independent of parsing, against the timestamp-stripped line,
EVERY active trigger per line, on a low-priority path. Match semantics: a
group literally named `YOU` must contain the player's name or the match is
dropped; a timer action calls the timer runtime (attacker/victim groups
default "None", Self forced true); audio is rate-limited to 1/second per
trigger; TTS text expands `$1` / `${name}` from the match. Imports and
replayed history never fire audio/timers. Restrict-to-category is a
case-insensitive SUBSTRING test of the category against the current zone
(instance numbers stripped), rebuilt on zone change.

**Spell timer definition fields** (share format `<Spell …/>`): `N` name,
`T` duration s (default 30), `WV` warning s (10), `RV` remove-at s (default
−15; negative lingers past zero), `A` absolute (one-only), `R`
restrict-to-me, `RC` restrict-to-category, `OM` only-master-ticks, `M`
modable, `RD` radial, `FC` ARGB colour, `Tt` tooltip, `C` category, optional
`SS`/`WS` start/warning sounds. Key = zone-qualified lowercase
`zone|category|name` (the same ability in two zones is two distinct timers).

**Runtime timer semantics**: `Notify(attacker, spell, self, victim, time,
zone)` is the single entry point — every combat action calls it with the
ability name, and triggers call it too. Selection prefers a definition whose
category matches the acting boss, then the current zone, so same-named
abilities across zones resolve correctly even before a zone line is seen.
Re-trigger within 2 s of the frame's newest timer → absorbed (tick chain);
within the sub-timer window → sub-bar (no sound reset); a hit after real
silence, or after the countdown expired, → new master timer (sounds reset).
Timers tick on interpolated log time. Recast/haste mods sum de-duplicated by
name; final = base × (1 + Σ mods). Owner death within 2 s of start removes
their mods; a dispel within 1 s drops the debuff mod.

## 5. Engine API surface

The grammar module turns each parsed line into calls on a small engine API:
`SetEncounter` then `AddSwing(swingType, critical, special, attacker,
attackType, dnum, time, timeSorter, victim, damageType)`. `special` is
normalized ("hit"/"hits"/blank → "None"); names are trimmed and upper-cased
for keying; "Unknown" (dumbfire/ground-effect damage with no real source) is
excluded from ally bookkeeping; the space-in-name heuristic marks NPCs/pets.
These heuristics are inherited from 20 years of EQ2 log conventions, not from
any one tool — the log format is the shared reality every EQ2 parser reads.
